          </ul>

          <h2>Onshore vs. Offshore Wind Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Wind energy can be harnessed both on land and at sea, with each
            method offering unique advantages and challenges.
          </p>
          <p>Comparison of onshore and offshore wind energy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Onshore Wind:</strong> Easier to install and maintain but
              can face land use conflicts and variable wind speeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Offshore Wind:</strong> Accesses stronger, more consistent
              winds but requires higher investment and complex infrastructure.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Challenges in Wind Energy Adoption</h2>
